\chapter{Theoretical background}\label{background}

In this chapter we will provide the necessary background needed for the user to
understand the mechanisms used later in the paper. The description of the
following systems is a brief introduction, intended to familiarize the reader
with concepts that are fundamental for the each one.

Specifically, section \ref{sec:gzip} describes the functionality of the gzip
compression software and the algorithms that it entails. Section
\ref{sec:sameorigin} covers the same-origin policy that applies in the web
application security model. In section \ref{sec:tls} we explain the Transport
Layer Security, which is the current widely used protocol that provide
communications security over the Internet. Finally, in section \ref{sec:mitm} we
describe attack methodologies in order for an adversary to perform a
Man-in-the-Middle attack, such as ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning.

\section{gzip}\label{sec:gzip}

gzip is a software application used for file compression and decompression. It
is the most used compression method on the Internet, integrated in protocols
such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Extensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol (XMPP) and many more. Derivatives of gzip include the tar
utility, which can extract .tar.gz files, as well as zlib, an abstraction of the
DEFLATE algorithm in library
form.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip}}

It is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of LZ77 and Huffman
coding. DEFLATE could be described in short by the following encryption schema:

\begin{math}DEFLATE(m) = Huffman(LZ77(m))\end{math}

In the following sections we will briefly describe the functionality of both
these compression algorithms.

\subsection{LZ77}\label{subsec:lz77}

LZ77 is a lossless data compression algorithm published by A. Lempel and J. Ziv
in 1977 \cite{lz77}. It achieves compression by replacing repeated occurrences
of data with references to a copy of the same data existing earlier in the
uncompressed data stream. The reference is composed of a pair of numbers, the
first of which represents the length of the repeated portion and the second
describes the distance backward in the stream, all the way to the beginning of
the portion. In order to spot repeats, the protocol needs to keep track of some
amount of the most recent data, specifically the latest 32 kilobytes. This data
is held in a sliding window, so in order for a portion of data to be compressed,
the initial appearance of it needs to have occurred at most 32 Kb up the data
stream. Also, the minimum length of a text to be compressed is 3 characters and
compressed text can refer to literals as well as pointers.

Below you can see an example of a step-by-step execution of the algorithm for a
chosen text:

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{Step 7: Use a pointer pointing to itself} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagrams/lz77_7.png}\end{figure}

\subsection{Huffman coding}\label{subsec:huffman}

Huffman coding is also a lossless data compression algorithm developed by David
A. Huffman and published in 1952 \cite{huffman}. When compressing a text with
this algorithm, a variable-length code table is created to map source symbols to
bit streams. Each source symbol can be represented with less or more bits
compared to the uncompressed stream, so the mapping table is used to translate
source symbols into bit streams during compression and vice versa during
decompression. The mapping table could be represented as a binary tree of nodes,
where each leaf node represents a source symbol, which can be accessed from the
root of the tree by following the left path for 0 and the right path for 1. Each
source symbol can be represented only by leaf nodes, therefore the code is
prefix-free, i.e. no bit stream representing a source symbol can be the prefix
of any other bit stream representing a different source symbol. The final
mapping of source symbols to bit streams is calculated by finding the frequency
of appearance for each source symbol of the plaintext. That way, most common
symbols will be coded in shorter bit streams, resulting in a compression of the
initial text.

Below follows an example of a plaintext and a valid Huffman tree that can be
used for compressing it:

\section{Same-origin policy}\label{sec:sameorigin}

Same-origin policy is an important aspect of the web application security model.
According to that policy, a web browser allows scripts included in one page to
access data in a second page only if both pages have the same \texttt{origin}.
\texttt{Origin} is defined as the combination of Uniform Resource Identifier
(URI)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier}}
scheme, hostname and port number. For example, a document retrieved from the
website \textit{http://example.com/target.html} is not allowed, under the
same-origin policy, to access the Document-Object
Model\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model}} of a
web page retrieved from \textit{https://head.example.com/target.html}, since the
two websites have different URI scheme (\texttt{http} vs \texttt{https}) and
different hostname (\textit{example.com} vs \textit{head.example.com}).

Same-origin policy is particularly important in modern web applications, that
rely greatly on HTTP cookies to maintain authenticated sessions. If same-origin
policy was not implemented, the confidentiality and integrity of cookies, as
well as every other content of web pages, would have been compromised. However,
despite the use of same-origin policy by modern browsers, there exist attacks
that enable an adversary to bypass it and compromise a user's communication with
a website. Two major types of such attacks, cross-site scripting and cross-site
request forgery are described in the following subsections.

\subsection{Cross-site scripting}

Cross-site scripting
(XSS)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting}} is a
security vulnerability that allows an adversary to inject a client-side script
into web pages viewed by other users. That way, same-origin policy can be
bypassed and sensitive data handled by the vulnerable website may be
compromised. XSS could be divided into two major types, \texttt{non-persistent}
and \texttt{persistent}, which will be described below.

\texttt{Non-persistent} XSS vulnerabilities are the most common. They show up
when the web server does not parse the input, in order to escape or reject HTML
control characters, allowing for scripts injected to the input to run
unnoticeable.  Usual methods of performing non-persistent XSS include mail or
website URL links and search requests.

\texttt{Persistent} XSS occurs when data provided by the attacker are stored by
the server. Responses from the server toward different users will then include
the script injected from the attacker, allowing it to run automatically on the
victim's browsers, without need from the attacker to target them individually.
An example of such attack can occur when posting texts on social networks or
message boards.

\subsection{Cross-site request forgery}

Cross-site request forgery
(CSRF)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery}}
is an exploit that allows an attacker to issue unauthorized commands to a
website, on behalf of a user the website trusts.  The attacker can then forge a
request that performs actions or posts data on a website the victim is logged
in, execute remote code with root privileges or compromise a root certificate,
resulting in a breach of an entire Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

CSRF can be performed when the victim is trusted by a website and the attacker
can trick the victim's browser into sending HTTP requests to that website. For
example, when Alice visits a web page that contains the HTML image tag
\textit{<img
src="\url{http://bank.example.com/withdraw?account=Alice&amount=1000000&for=Mallory}">},
that Mallory has injected, a request from Alice's browser to the
\texttt{example} bank's website will be issued, stating for an amount of
1.000.000 to be transferred from Alice's account to Mallory's. If Alice is
logged in the \texttt{example} bank's website, the browser will include the
cookie containing Alice's authentication information in the request, validating
the request for the transfer. If the website does not perform more sanity checks
or further validation from Alice, the unauthorized transaction will be
completed. An attack like this is very common on Internet forums, where users
are allowed to post images.

A mitigation method for CSRF is a Cookie-to-Header token. The web application
sets a cookie, which contains a random token that validates a specific user
session. Client side reads that token and includes it in a HTTP header sent with
each request to the web application. Since only JavaScript running within the
same origin will be allowed to read the token, we can assume that its value is
safe from unauthorized scripts that aim read and copy it to a custom header, in
order to mark a rogue request as valid.

\section{Transport Layer Security}\label{sec:tls}

Transport Layer Security
(TLS)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security}} is
a protocol that provides security over the Internet, allowing a server and a
client to communicate in a way that prevents eavesdropping, tampering or message
forgery \cite{tls12}.

The users negotiate a symmetric key via asymmetric cryptography, that is
provided by X.509 certificates. In order for the certificates to be verified for
their owners, certificate authorities and PKIs have been created. However, it
can be understood that, due to their essential role, certificate authorities are
points of failure in the system, enabling for Man-in-the-Middle attacks, in case
an adversary has managed to forge a root certificate.

Apart from certificate-related attacks, a well-known category is compression
attacks \cite{compression_attacks}. Such attacks exploit TLS-level compression
in order to decrypt ciphertext. In this paper, we investigate the threat model
and performance of such an attack,
BREACH\footnote{\url{http://breachattack.com}}.

In the following subsections we will briefly describe the handshake negotiation
and the format of TLS records.

\subsection{TLS handshake}

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{TLS handshake flow} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagrams/tls_handshake.png}\end{figure}

The above sequence diagram presents the functionality of TLS handshake. User and
server exchange the basic parameters of the connection, that is the protocol
version, cipher suite, compression method and random numbers, via the
ClientHello and ServerHello records. The server then provides all information
needed so that the user validates and uses the asymmetric server key, in order
to compute the symmetric key that will be used for the rest of the
communication. The client computes a \texttt{PreMasterKey}, that is sent to the
server, which is then used by both parties to compute the symmetric key.
Finally, both sides exchange and validate hash and MAC codes over all the
previous messages, after which they both have the ability to communicate safely.

This functionality is applied only for the basic TLS handshake.
Client-authenticated and resumed handshakes work similarly, however they are not
relevant for the purpose of this paper.

\subsection{TLS record}

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{TLS record} \centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/tls_record.png}\end{figure}

The above figure depicts the general format of all TLS records.

The first field defines the Record Layer Protocol Type of the record, which can
be one of the following:

\begin{table}[H] \centering \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | } \hline \textbf{Hex} &
\textbf{Type} \\ \hline 0x14 & ChangeCipherSpec \\ 0x15 & Alert \\ 0x16 &
Handshake \\ 0x17 & Application \\ 0x18 & Heartbeat \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The second field defines the TLS version for the record message, which is
identified by the major and minor numbers as below:

\begin{table}[H] \centering \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | } \hline
\textbf{Major} & \textbf{Minor} & \textbf{Version} \\ \hline 3 & 0 & SSL 3.0 \\
3 & 1 & TLS 1.0 \\ 3 & 2 & TLS 1.1 \\ 3 & 3 & TLS 1.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The aggregated length of the payload of the record, the MAC and the padding is
then calculated by the following two fields as: \begin{math}256*(bits 15..8) +
(bits 7..0)\end{math}.

Finally, the payload of the record, which, depending on the type, may be
encrypted, the MAC, if provided, and the padding, if needed, make up the rest of
the TLS record.

\section{Man-in-the-Middle}\label{sec:mitm}

Man-in-the-Middle
(MitM)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack}} is
one of the most common attack vectors, where an attacker reroutes the
communication of two parties, in order to be controlled and possibly altered.
The aggressiveness of the attack can vary from passive eavesdropping to full
control of the communication, as long as the attacker is able to impersonate
both parties and convince them to be trusted.

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{Man-in-the-Middle.} \centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagrams/mitm.png}\end{figure}

MitM attacks can be mitigated by using end-to-end cryptography, mutual
authentication or PKIs. However, some attacks manage to bypass such mitigation
techniques. Below, we describe two such attacks, ARP Spoofing and DNS cache
poisoning.

\subsection{ARP Spoofing}

ARP spoofing\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing}} is a
technique where an attacker sends Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages
over the network, so that the IP address of a host is associated with the MAC
address of the attacker's machine. That way, the attacker may intercept the
traffic, modify or deny packets, performing Denial-of-Service, MitM or session
hijacking attacks.

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{Arp Spoofing} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{diagrams/arp_spoofing.png}\end{figure}

ARP spoofing can also be used for legitimate reasons, when a developer needs to
debug IP traffic between two hosts. The developer can then act as proxy between
the two hosts, configuring a switch that is used by the two parties to forward
the traffic to the proxy for monitoring purposes.

\subsection{DNS Spoofing}

\begin{figure}[H] \caption{DNS Spoofing} \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{diagrams/dns_spoofing.png}\end{figure}

DNS spoofing (or DNS cache
poisoning)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing}} is an
attack, when the adversary introduces data into a Domain Name System resolver's
cache, in order to return an incorrect address for a specific host.

DNS servers are usually provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and used
to resolve IP addresses to human-readable hostnames faster. A malicious
employee, or anyone that has gained unauthorized access to the server, can
perform DNS poisoning, affecting every user that uses the specific server.
