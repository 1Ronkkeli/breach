\section{Thesis structure}\label{sec:structure}

This thesis is structured as follows:

\begin{description} \item{Chapter \ref{background}} \hfill \\

This Chapter provides the reader with basic information, both technical and
theoretical, that will be referenced later in this paper. It consists of a brief
description of the most common compression algorithms, as well as basic
standards and protocols used for communications security over the Internet,
along with exploits against them. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:pcpa}} \hfill \\

We introduce a new property of cryptosystems, providing both formal and
intuitive definitions for it. We compare it to known encryption properties and
present attack scenarios on the proposed scheme. Finally, we describe known
exploits that follow the described attack vector. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:attack}} \hfill \\

We describe in depth the attack model that is investigated in this work. We
elaborate on our implementation for this model, present vulnerabilities on major
websites that were found during this work, as well as a methodology for
confirming whether the attack is possible on a chosen endpoint. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:statistic}} \hfill \\

This chapter includes statistical methods that were used during our
investigation. It proposes probabilistic techniques to bypass impediments, along
with various optimization processes. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:experiment}} \hfill \\

We present the results of multiple experiments on widely used endpoints. We
include charts, along with definition of success, for each case. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:mitigation}} \hfill \\

We present various mitigation methods of the described attack model. We
investigate the efficiency of proposed methods, under the scope of new findings
in this work, and present various novel mitigation techniques, that potentially
eliminate the attack.\hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{conclusion}} \hfill \\

We provide concluding remarks and propose future work, that could be done to
improve the attack model and minimize its consequences. \hfill \\

\item{Chapter \ref{ch:appendix}} \hfill \\

This chapter includes our code implementation of the attack.  \end{description}
